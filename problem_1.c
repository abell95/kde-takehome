// Ordered Binary Tree

// A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children,
// which are referred to as the left child and the right child. Often, binary tree
// implementations have the invariant that its elements appear in order. Your task
// is to implmenet an ordered binary tree in C whose values are integers. Include
// a function with the following prototype:
// void insert(tree_t* tree, int value)

// The insert function should take a pointer to a tree and an integer value, in-
// serting the integer as a leaf node such that the treeâ€™s ordering invariant is main-
// tained. The tree does not need to maintain any other invariants, such as balance.
